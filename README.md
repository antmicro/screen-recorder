# Screen recorder

Antmicro's simple WebRTC-based screen recorder, for making videos or GIFs (not yet fully working at this time) - based on [RecordRTC](https://github.com/muaz-khan/RecordRTC)

The reason this was created is because we wanted a one-file solution that does not need a server (since WebRTC works fine fully client-side) and is tailored to our needs (defaults, UI etc.)

This is an early stage work in progress tool, PRs welcome.

Aagain, GIFs do not fully work yet, sadly.

## Usage (online)

Open:

* [video-recorder](./video-recorder.html)
* [gif-recorder](./gif-recorder.html)

And enjoy.

There is a start and stop button, and the rest is handled by the browser really, so if you've ever used Google Meet or Zoom etc., you should be fine.

## Usage (local)

Download ``{video,gif}-recorder.html`` and open it in the browser of your choice (unless the browser of your choice is Internet Explorer or Safari, in which case, [tough luck](https://github.com/muaz-khan/RecordRTC#browsers-support)). Rest is same as above.
